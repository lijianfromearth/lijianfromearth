Hi there 👋  
I am Lijian, a Research Assistant at the shanghaitech MARS Lab, working with Prof. Sören Schwertfeger.  
Currently, my work is focused on **Dexterous Hand Manipulation**, **Diffusion Models**, and **Quadruped Control**.  

Before joining ShanghaiTech, I worked at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Software Development Center (Beijing). I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tianjin University of Finance and Economics in 2020.

## Project Experience  

### Generation of 6DOF Grasp Poses using Internal Constraints and Open Semantic Affordance  
*Utilizing Flowmatching and RL (Work in Progress)*  
- Our work aims to improve the generation effect of the 2024 ICRA article *Language-Conditioned Affordance-Pose Detection in 3D Point Clouds*.  
- So far, our pose generation effect has far exceeded that of the article, with **90%** of the generated poses being correct.
